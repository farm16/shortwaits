    <h1>Privacy Policy - Shortwaits Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Because Shortwaits understands that the privacy of your personal information is important to you, we have established privacy policies and practices. This notice explains
      how your data will be used and shared by Shortwaits. By visiting Shortwaits.com, you accept the policies and practices described in this privacy policy. This privacy policy
      is incorporated into, and is subject to, the Terms of Use. Any capitalized terms not defined in this policy have the meaning set forth in the Terms of Use.</p>

    <h2>What Our Privacy Policy Covers</h2>
    <p>Shortwaits is committed to the privacy and confidentiality of the information provided by its users. This Privacy Policy describes the type of personal data that Shortwaits
      (“Shortwaits,” “we,” or “us”) collects through your use of our website, our products, support, payment and mobile apps, our marketing, demonstrations, and promotions, and our
      communications with you through our website or by phone, email, or live chat and online services, including your comments and feedback (collectively, the “Services”). The
      term “Personal Data” refers to any information relating to an identifiable person who can be directly or indirectly identified in particular by reference to an identifier.
      Personal Data includes, without limitation, personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, date of birth, email address or postal address, and payment
      information. Please note that by submitting Personal Data manually or in electronic form to us and/or by using our website, you give your consent that all Personal Data
      submitted on each occasion may be processed by and/or shared with Shortwaits and its service providers, in the manner and for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
      If you do not want us to collect or process Personal Data, please do not provide it, but you may not be able to take advantage of our Services or certain features of our
      Services.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us. As an example, all credit card information is encrypted
      using secure socket layer technology (SSL). However, no method of transmission is 100% secure. Therefore, Shortwaits does not guarantee any confidentiality or privacy with
      respect to any of your personal information or User Submissions. Shortwaits does not assume any liability to third parties whose information you include on the Site, or which
      you post in any User Submissions. Please keep your username and password secure.</p>

    <h2>Importing Google Contacts</h2>
    <p>Shortwaits enables users to import their existing Google contacts to their Shortwaits accounts to create customer contacts. This import feature is powered by Google OAuth
      and Shortwaits, which requests the owner of the Shortwaits account to authorize the transfer of contact information and does not attempt to access your Google password.
      Shortwaits doesn’t use the contact information obtained during the import process for other purposes or push it to external 3rd party apps without your consent.</p>

    <h2>Children’s Information</h2>
    <p>Shortwaits’s services, platform, and communications whether educational or marketing in nature are not directed at children under thirteen years of age. We do not knowingly
      collect personal information from children under thirteen. If we obtain actual knowledge that a child under thirteen has provided personal information to us, we will promptly
      delete that information. Please report any suspected instances to privacy@shortwaits.com.</p>

    <h2>Information You Provide Voluntarily</h2>
    <p><strong>Signup Information:</strong>
      When you sign up for the Shortwaits platform, you will be asked to provide your name, email address, phone number, physical or mailing address, business name, and industry
      type, as well as information related to your business service offerings, working hours, and staff members.</p>
    <p><strong>Customer or Staff Information:</strong>
      With your consent, you may import staff or customer contact information to Shortwaits for the purposes of scheduling appointments, events, or classes with staff or customers.
      This information includes the staff or customer’s name, phone number, email address, physical or mailing address, and an image of their likeness. For example, with your
      consent, you may link your Shortwaits account with your Google Contacts account or other similar service, which allows Shortwaits to obtain personal information from that
      account. This import feature is powered by Google OAuth and Shortwaits, which requests the Shortwaits account owner to authorize the transfer of contact information and does
      not attempt to access your Google password. Shortwaits does not use the contact information obtained during the import process for any other purpose and does not share
      contact information with third parties without your consent.</p>
    <p><strong>Staff Profiles:</strong>
      A Shortwaits account holder may create one or more additional staff profiles with his or her colleagues or members of their organization. Those colleagues or members may
      voluntarily give us certain information. This can include their names, email addresses, phone numbers, and short descriptions of personal or professional characteristics
      intended to inform the Shortwaits user’s customers or clientele. If you receive an invitation from a Shortwaits account holder but do not wish to become a Shortwaits user,
      please contact the account holder who sent the invitation to discuss other means of managing your appointment calendar.</p>
    <p><strong>External Calendars:</strong>
      A Shortwaits user may also connect their external or third-party calendar with Shortwaits, if they have a Shortwaits Premium subscription. Our 2-way calendar sync integration
      will check the duration and free/busy status of the events in your external calendar, as well as the titles of any events. We do not check who you’re meeting with, their
      email, or any other details about events in your calendar.</p>
    <p><strong>Billing Information:</strong>
      If you purchase a paid subscription to Shortwaits Premium or Shortwaits Live Booking, our third-party payment processors will collect and store your billing address and
      credit card information.</p>
    <p><strong>Technical Support:</strong>
      If you call, email, or otherwise contact Shortwaits for technical support, you may provide personal information such as your name, email address, or phone number to
      Shortwaits.</p>

    <h2>Third Party Integrations within Shortwaits</h2>
    <p>Shortwaits integrates with a number of third-party apps and software platforms to allow for greater functionality and expanded services offerings. Some examples of these
      integrations include MailChimp and Infusionsoft, for which the Shortwaits user must maintain their own MailChimp or Infusionsoft account, respectively. If you use these
      integrations within Shortwaits, you should be aware of the separate privacy policies for those services and platforms. It is also important to obtain your customers’ consent
      before passing or transmitting their personal information from Shortwaits to a third-party app.</p>

    <p>When handling requests from your customers to remove personal data from your systems, you may be obligated to remove personal data from any third-party platforms that you
      have activated an integration with in your Shortwaits account. Shortwaits cannot, for example, delete personal information held by MailChimp as part of your usage of a
      MailChimp account. However, Shortwaits will practice due diligence in supporting any requests to delete personal information from a third-party app, service, or platform,
      insofar as Shortwaits can assist in helping the Shortwaits user communicate those requests to third-party apps, services, and platforms directly.</p>

    <p>“General Data Protection Regulation” (GDPR) is a European Union (EU) regulation designed to protect EU citizen privacy when it comes to submitting personal data to a
      business or service. Shortwaits is generally considered to be a “data processor,” which provides tools to help you as a Shortwaits user become GDPR compliant, but ultimately
      that responsibility is up to you as the “data controller.” Please refer to the Shortwaits blog and Shortwaits support website for more information on best practices in
      meeting GDPR compliance.</p>

    <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
    <p>This notice replaces all previous disclosures we may have provided you about our information practices. We reserve the right to revise and modify this policy at any time,
      without notice, and to apply these changes in policy to information previously collected, where legally permissible. We will notify you of changes by posting the policy
      changes on our website. Your continued use of the Site constitutes your acceptance of this privacy policy and any updates. This privacy policy is effective as of May 25,
      2018.</p>

    <h2>California Privacy</h2>
    <p>If you are a California resident, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you to request information regarding the disclosure of your Personal Data by Shortwaits to a
      third party for the third party’s direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to [] or write us at the address listed below.</p>

    <h2>Do Not Track Requests</h2>
    <p>We do not process “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) signals. Our third-party service providers may also not respond to DNT signals.</p>

    <h2>About HIPAA Compliance</h2>
    <p>Shortwaits does not currently meet HIPAA compliance. The Shortwaits platform sends customer information [i] in email notifications to Shortwaits users who are account
      holders or staff members with a Shortwaits staff profile, and [ii] to your Google Calendar or Microsoft Office 365 Calendar if you have a 2-way sync activated with your
      Shortwaits Premium subscription. We DO NOT share your customer’s information with any other third parties.</p>
