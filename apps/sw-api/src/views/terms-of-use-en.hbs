    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

    <p>Welcome to the Shortwaits.com website (collectively, including all content and functionality available through the Shortwaits.com domain name, the Shortwaits blog,
      downloadable software, mobile applications (including tablet applications) and other services provided by us, referred to as the “Site”). By accessing or using the Site, you
      (Site visitor, or “User”), whether registered or not, accept these Terms of Use (“Agreement”), including as applicable Shortwaits Data Processing Addendum ("DPA") and our
      Privacy Policy, which are incorporated into the Agreement, and agree to be bound by these terms and all applicable laws of the State of Oregon and the United States of
      America. The Privacy Policy is available for review
      <a href="https://www.shortwaits.com/v1/shortwaits/privacy-policy/en">
        here</a>.

    <h2>Use of Site</h2>

    <p>The Site is not intended for and may not be used by individuals who are under thirteen years of age. By registering a Shortwaits account, the Site visitor or User promises
      that they are at least eighteen years of age. The Site may not be used to gain or attempt to gain a competitive advantage in Shortwaits's industry market or be used for any
      commercial purpose. Services and products are intended only for persons who are legally permitted to enter binding contracts. The information, opinions, images, messages,
      website links, text information, music, videos, graphics, files, ideas, data, and any other content provided to us by Users (“User Submissions”) and uploaded, published,
      displayed, or otherwise made available (“posted”) on the Site is not endorsed by Shortwaits. Users are solely responsible for the submissions he or she posts. Users retain
      all ownership rights in his or her own User Submissions. However, by submitting User Submissions to the Site, Users have the right to grant to Shortwaits a non-exclusive,
      worldwide, non-revocable, transferable, royalty-free, and perpetual right to use the User Submissions. Users' rights are in any manner or media now or later developed, for
      any purpose, commercial, advertising, or otherwise, including the right to translate, display, sublicense, reproduce, create derivative works, distribute, assign, and
      commercialize without any payment due to the User. User Submissions are not confidential or proprietary.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Software Integrations</h2>

    <p>Shortwaits integrates with a number of third-party apps and software platforms to allow for greater functionality and expanded services offerings. Some examples of these
      integrations include MailChimp and Infusionsoft, for which the Shortwaits user must maintain their own MailChimp or Infusionsoft account, respectively. Users may access
      content, products, or services from these third parties through hyperlinks, banners, images, emails, in-app messages, APIs, or other means. If you access any third-party
      content, products, or services through the Site, you should be aware of the separate Privacy Policies and Terms of Use for those third parties. Some of these third-party
      integrations, for example, Stripe or Square, provide electronic web-based transaction platforms for the User to accept, manage, or otherwise process monetary or credit
      transactions supporting the exchange of products and services with their customers or other entities. For any such transaction, Shortwaits does not represent either the
      seller or buyer, and has no control over and is not liable for the quality, safety, lawfulness, or availability of any products or services offered. The User agrees that
      Shortwaits shall not be liable or responsible for any damages, claims, liabilities, costs, harms, inconveniences, privacy law violations, data breaches, business disruptions,
      or expenditures of any kind that may arise or result from or in connection with any transactions carried out through these third-party integrations. In the event that any
      User has a dispute with any party to a transaction, the User agrees to release, hold harmless, and indemnify Shortwaits from all claims, demands, actions, proceedings, costs,
      expenses, and damages arising out of or in connection with any transaction or dispute.</p>

    <h2>Subscription Fees for Paid Services</h2>

      any services provided by Shortwaits as described on the Shortwaits Products page and in related sub-pages, which are available for review

      costs such as overage fees and taxes, at regular intervals as set forth in each paid product description. Shortwaits will automatically renew and charge your payment method
      based on the subscription plan chosen, plus any additional overage or service fees, plus arrears due to failure to process a payment owed during a previous billing cycle if
      applicable. Payments are non-refundable, but Shortwaits may consider a request to refund a past payment on a case-by-case basis. By creating an account and upgrading to a
      paid subscription for a Shortwaits product or service, you consent to allow Shortwaits to charge your credit card (or other payment method) through its payment processors for
      the amounts due for your initial subscription period and for additional subscription periods until your account is downgraded back to the Free, Basic Shortwaits plan, or
      until your canceled or deleted. Paid accounts will automatically renew at the start of each new subscription period unless you downgrade the account to a free plan or cancel
      the account. Downgrading or cancellation will be effective immediately, and you will not be entitled to a refund of any payments for the remainder of the unused subscription
      period. You may downgrade or cancel your Shortwaits account by sending an email to
      <a href="mailto:help@shortwaits.com">help@shortwaits.com</a>
      or by navigating through the settings menus in the Shortwaits product.</p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability and Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>Shortwaits provides the site "as is" and does not claim to make any warranties, express or implied, about the serviceability, merchantability, fitness for a particular
      purpose, or content of the site. Shortwaits further does not warrant that its site or applicable server is free from viruses or other potentially harmful code. Neither
      Shortwaits nor any of its service providers shall be liable for any claims arising from any use or inability to use products or services, privacy law violations, data

      harmless Shortwaits and its service providers from damages, and neither party will be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or any damages whatsoever

      Data may be transferred to other countries outside the domicile of User or its Personnel, and that the protections afforded Personal Data under applicable laws and
